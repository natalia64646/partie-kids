                    <p class="about-us-text">The company was founded by three moms of little boys and girls aimed to
                        share
                        their experience of throwing parties and make parents lives easier. Alice, Robin, and Lucy,
                        three founders of the company, had quite a journey planning parties for their children and faced
                        all
                        the possible complications and challenges. It was not an easy task, so in the end, they had to
                        figure out the easiest way
                        for parents to relax while kids are having fun and developed their own methods of planning,
                        organizing, and carrying out an original party for children.
                        That's how the idea for the Rainbow Parties was born. By figuring out innovative ways of
                        organizing
                        and planning kids' parties, our team helps parents save money without sacrificing
                        their kids' holiday experiences. This way, children's holidays can remain relaxing for the
                        entire
                        family. While our event-managers and chefs handle the fun part, parents are chilling, talking to
                        other parents, and just have a good time. </p>

                            <p>Classics are proven with time and generations and never get old, no matter how much
                                smartphones and social media conquer kids' minds. Great food, amazing music, designed
                                theme,
                                and active games have been the main ingredients of a fun party for many centuries and
                                generations, and
                                surprisingly, things haven't changed much. Of course, classics have to be neither boring
                                nor
                                old-fashioned. At Rainbow Parties, we combine the eternal basics with new trends and
                                technologies, adapting
                                time-proven methods to the likes of the latest generation. </p>

                            <p>Deluxe Party is a great option for those who do not settle for less. If you want to go
                                all
                                the way in for your kid's holiday, that's exactly the option for you. The craziest food
                                choices, rare
                                themes, and multi-level quests and games – and it's not even a full list yet. Basically,
                                Deluxe Party is a VIP version of Classics. It bases on those same key components of any
                                great gvent but takes it to a whole other level. You may rest assured: whatever idea you
                                have for your kid's special day, it will be implemented. No limitations! </p>
